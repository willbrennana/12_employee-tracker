# Willy B's Employee Tracker

This is my first challenge using MySQL.

While the process behind creating the database for this tracker took more hours, it was a great way to get more familiar with linking original data to an app using tables in MySQL 2.0 and .sql and .js files with Inquirer and Node.js VS Code.

The most difficult task was joining tables wiithin the initial and final db.query statements, as the initial attempts to pull the data from each table within the schema.sql file did not display enough info to meet the Acceptance Criteria.

On that note, as specified in the Challenge Acceptance Criteria, the note taker achieves the following:

✨ The CLI presents the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.

✨ The CLI presents a formatted table showing department names and department ids.

✨ The "All roles" option presents the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for all roles.

✨ The "Employees" option presents a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers to which the employees report.

✨ The "Add a department" option prompts user to enter and add the name of the department to the database.

✨ The "Add a role" option prompts user to enter and add the name, salary, and department for the role to the database.

✨ The "Add an employee" option prompts user to enter and add the employee’s first name, last name, role, and manager to the database.

✨ The "Update an employee's role" option prompts user to select an employee and update their new role and this information in the database.
